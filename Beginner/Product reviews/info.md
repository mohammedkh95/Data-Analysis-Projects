I asked ChatGPT to create this dataframe for me.

Its quite difficult to find dirty datasets online or from Kaggle (or I dont know how to search). 
I asked ChatGPT to create a dataframe where I may need to split columns, clean cell values, normalize how strings look like, create ratings based on certain strings etc (you can check the main.ipnynb)
It was exciting do revisit all of these again and I plan to go extra miles after this.

I also uploaded the dataset to Power BI to conjure up insights, mainly:
  1. Ratings per Product
  2. City popularity
  3. Feedback analysis
  4. Products sold per country

I'm sure there's more insights to uncover however I didnt want to overwhelm this project alot, it was such a small dataset.

Next stop, a slightly more complex dataset. I want to focus on the cleaning aspect alot as well cause I believe it would it simplify what insihgts I can uncover.
